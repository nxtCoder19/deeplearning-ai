# LLM
    In the context of AI, "LLM" likely refers to "Large Language Model." A Large Language Model is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of training data. These models are capable of performing tasks such as language translation, text generation, question answering, and more.

# what are prompting

    In the context of large language models like GPT-3, "prompting" refers to the input or instructions provided to the model in order to elicit a desired output. When you interact with a language model, you provide a prompt that specifies what you want the model to do or generate.

# Token

    Token is all about 4 char or 3/4 of word.
    In chat gpt 3.5 to tal token should be 4000 by adding input(prompt, message) and output

# Supervised learning

    Supervised learning is a category of machine learning where an algorithm learns to map input data to desired output labels based on a training dataset. In supervised learning, the algorithm is "supervised" by providing it with labeled examples to learn from, which means each input data point is associated with a corresponding correct output label. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function that can accurately predict or classify new, unseen data.

# Chaining prompts

-   Reduce number of token used in prompt
-   skip some chains of the workflow when not needed for the task
-   Easier to test include human in a loop
-   for complex task, keep track of state,
    external to LLM(in your own code)
-   use external tools (web search, database)
-   More focus (Break down a complec task)
-   content limitations (max token for input prompt and output response)
-   Reduce costs (pay per token)
